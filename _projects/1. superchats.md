## Challenges and knowledge acquired

### Setting up the service worker (PWA)

Getting the PWA aspect of the app to work was really hard because the documentation isn't very informative for web push notification and some blogs or articles are outdated. The requesting to download an app to the user was the easier part. I had to see how things work through trial and error. The two best places that helped me figure out web push notification was this [github repo](https://github.com/mozilla/serviceworker-cookbook/tree/master/push-get-payload) and this google [blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/push-notifications/). The main reason why it was difficult is that most blog post used firebase cloud messaging, which requires the use of firebase which is owned by google, to generate an endpoint to use for web push notification I choose not to use this because I was already using Mongodb for everything else. All it did was generate a subscription endpoint using a private and public key. Knowing this information I use the library [web push](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push) to generate the keys and make a subscription and stored this subscription so I can use it to send notifications to people that subscribed to it.


### Designing the logo

I chose to use a basic design because I noticed how every other successful chatting services uses a simple design for their logo such as facebook and snapchat. I had to create different sizes for all the different ways the app can be downloaded.

## Designing the view

Designed using the mobile first approach.

<div class="img-container">
 <img class="img-container__img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/superchats-login-register-design.png" alt="superchats website design">
</div>

Register and login UI.

<div class="img-container">
 <img class="img-container__img" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/superchats-messaging-ui.png" alt="superchats website design">
</div>

Messaging UI.

At first I tried a dark theme but It didn't match up with the whole site so I changed it to a light theme.
