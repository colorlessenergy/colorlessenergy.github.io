## what is this

## technologies

    </span>
</div>

## challenges and knowledge acquired

The website is built with Jekyll because it allows to create blogs and split different parts of the website into files to avoid repeating code.

The goal of codinglead is to be a resource where people can copy and paste code snippets and learn from them.

I had an issue with how to display the navigation, I had to choose to display all the links or have a hamburger menu with all the links. I decided it would be better to have a hamburger menu because I have more than 3 links.
