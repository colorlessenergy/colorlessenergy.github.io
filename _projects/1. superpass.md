## what is this

SuperPass is a password management system. Once you make an account you can make storages for apps called applications and for every application you can store your accounts for that applications.

## Front End Tech

* Node
* Express
* Mongo
* JWT

## Hosting

* Mlabs to host MongoDB
* Heroku to host my password manager Api and Front End

## version control

* Git

## Design Software

* Figma


## challenges and knowledge acquired

## Built REST api

I decided to make a User, Application, and Password as objects and make CRUD request to them. Since I used mongodb it was difficult to reference two collections to each other so I decided just to store the applications and the accounts inside the User object. This is a design choice I could later on change by having different Objects for the Applications and for every account.

## Learnt Mongodb and Mongoose

I have had experience with designing schemas with Sequelize it was very similar to how schemas are made in mongoose. I used Mlab to deploy my mongodb online.

## Learnt about authorization with JWT

Looked at the JsonWebToken docs on NPM and learnt how to authorize users with a JWT token. I decided to include the id, username and passwordstorage as the payload for the JWT. I learnt how important it is to make sure my users data is secured and only they should be able to look at it.

## learnt about pug

Pug is a templating engine. Very easy to pick up the syntax it is normal HTML but with not closing tags or angle brackets.

## learnt about stylus

Very similar to SASS. Made it very easy to use BEM methodologies.


## Designed the logo

Learned a little bit about design and made my logo. I first thought about chains for the design but didn't really like how it looked. Then I decided that a lock will be the best because you can think of passwords as a key to the lock.
