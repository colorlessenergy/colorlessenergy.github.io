## core features

### food blocks

The food blocks are stored in localStorage which allows the web app to perform CRUD operations offline. 

The food blocks were designed for ease of use and to look fun by giving it a cartoonish feel.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/calorie-tracker-food-block.png" alt="calorie tracker food block" title="calorie tracker food block">
</div>


To ease the flow of creating a food block a button is added to the home screen thats add a new empty food block and opens a modal to fill in the data.

Also when clicking on a food block a modal opens with a form to edit the food block data.

### duplicate and merge previous day

One of the previous 10 days can be duplicated and merged with the current day.

### food dictionary

I noticed there was a pain point where I need to find out how many calories a certain food has and calculate how many calories the food I am eating has.

To help with this issue I created the food dictionary page which allows you to create a food block and calculate the calories by inputting the amount.

### snackbars

I noticed when I submitted forms it seemed that they didn't do anything because there weren't any visual cues. I decided to use Snackbars to make it clear that the forms were submitted.

### reward system

Confetti falls from the top of the screen when the calorie goal is met.
