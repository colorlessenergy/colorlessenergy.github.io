## what is this

SuperPass is a password management system. Once you make an account you can make storages for every app called applications and for every application you can store many account login information. For example you can make an application called "league of legends" then you can store as many accounts as you want into that application.

## challenges and knowledge acquired


### Built REST api

My Front End Utilizes a API that I built following the REST standards. I decided to make a User, Application, and Password as the main objects in the REST api. Since I used mongodb it was difficult to reference two collections to each other so I decided just to store the applications and the accounts inside the User object. This is a design choice I could later on change by having different Objects for the Applications and for every account.

### Mongodb and Mongoose

I have had experience with designing schemas with Sequelize it was very similar to how schemas are made in Mongoose. Mlabs has a free tier that give you 500 mb of free storage.


### Authorization with JWT

Looked at the JsonWebToken docs on NPM and learnt how to authorize users with a JWT token. I decided to include the id, username and password storage as the payload for the JWT. I learnt how important it is to make sure my users data is secured and only they should be able to look at it.

### Pug

Pug is a templating engine. It is very easy to pick up and add a lot of functionality.

### Stylus

It is very similar to SASS. Made it very easy to implement BEM methodologies.


### Logo

Learned a little bit about design and made my logo. I first thought about chains for the design but didn't really like how it looked. I decided that a lock would be the best to use because you can think of passwords as a key to a lock.

### Website

Took a mobile first approach when designing the website.
