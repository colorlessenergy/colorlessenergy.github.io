## what is this


Letter-gg was built for people that played <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/events/teamfight-tactics">teamfight tactics</a>. Once an account is created you can make guides about strageies that you haved used in the game. People can comment and like guides. I spent a lot of time desiging a platform where it is easy to create guides and look at specific guides for a certain character in the game.

## challenges and knowledge acquired


### Firebase

Using firebase is like having your own personal backend development team. There are some limits and the learning curve starts off easy but when you are trying to create something complex the limits will make you have to create hacks to make it work. Overall I would use firebase when I am creating something small that requires a database.

### There isn't a unique field in firestore

Firestore does not have a unique fields. This was an issue when trying to create unique usernames. To solve this issue I had to create a collection with the id of each doc being the username. Everytime a user was created this collection had to be queried by ID to see if the username was already created. If it wasn't create a new user and add the username as an ID to the collectio otherwise show the user a message that the username is already taken.


### Logo

I research about logo designed and learned that logos should be a identifier and doesn't have to mean anything It just needs to be identifiable.

Knowing that logos should be unique I decided to use circles and move them around until I couldn't really identify it with something. For the final design overlapped two circles and it made an arc which I liked. :)

### UI

A mobile first approach was taken when designing because It will guarantee that all screens will be supported
