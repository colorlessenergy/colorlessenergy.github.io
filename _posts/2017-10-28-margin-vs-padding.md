## margin

margin is for positioning.

Margin can also collapse which means that if two margins are the same it makes it as one. Don't ask me why
they decided to do this because I don't know why.....

## padding

padding is for making the content more interactive.

For Example if you were to add a hover effect on a DOM element the padding will get the effect you add.
