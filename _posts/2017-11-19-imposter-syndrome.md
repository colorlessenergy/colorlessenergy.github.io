impostor syndrome affects everyone especially people trying to build things with code....

There isn't a cure for it. Impostor syndrome is when you feel like you are a fraud and are scared that if you fail you will be exposed as a "fraud". The only way to fight it is to reflect on your journey and where you came from. This is the only way you will see self worth. Everyone feels like they are a impostor at times but it can be used as a way to motivate yourself.
