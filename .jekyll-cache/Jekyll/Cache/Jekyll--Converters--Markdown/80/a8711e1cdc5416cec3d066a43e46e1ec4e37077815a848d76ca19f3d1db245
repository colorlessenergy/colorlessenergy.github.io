<h2 id="what-is-this">what is this</h2>

<p>A progressive web app that utilizes a service worker to browse Reddit offline.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use">how to use</h2>

<p>You enter the subreddit you are trying to visit in the search box. Once you initially search a subreddit with an internet connection you will be able to view it offline. it will prompt you to download it to your home screen and if you are on safari you will have to manually do it yourself.</p>

<h3 id="main-problem">main problem</h3>

<p>Reddit loaded too slow on my phone so I decided to use their API to make a web app that loaded way faster because there is less stuff having to be loaded.</p>

<h3 id="design-doc">design doc</h3>

<p>I made a design doc at the start to map out how the app will be made and what will be used to make it.</p>

<h3 id="service-worker">service worker</h3>

<p>The service worker caches every request made to be able to load it faster the next time someone visits the same subreddit.</p>

<p>A problem I had with this is that the JSON fetched from the Reddit API will never be updated because every time a request is made the service worker intercepts it and gets it from the cache. I realize the only content that ever changes is the JSON files that are fetched from the Reddit API so I always made a network request for them and cached the new one every time a subreddit was searched.</p>

<p>I am very proud of this project because I fixed a problem I had.</p>
