<p>I used Jekyll which is a static site generator.</p>

<p>I had to create a collection for every type of blog post to stay organized. The different collections I have are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and courses.</p>

<p>I decided to make text courses instead of videos because I like to think the courses will be a guide you can go back to specific sections.</p>

<p>Ultimately I wanted it to be a resource where people can copy and paste code snippets and learn from them.</p>

<p>I was thinking about either not having a hamburger menu on a responsive layout and just have them be there or having a hamburger menu. I decided it would be better to have a hamburger because I had more than 3 links.</p>
