<h2 id="what-this-is">What this is</h2>

<p>coding lead is a website to post content about front end web development. It currently has two authors me and <a href="https://planeswalker1.github.io/">daniel</a>.</p>

<h2 id="built-with">Built with</h2>

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>jekyll</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>I used jekyll which is a static site generator. I had to create a collection to be able separate post about HTML, CSS and JavaScript from courses.</p>

<p>I had to figure out how I am going to teach people. I decided to make text courses instead of videos because I like to think the courses will be a guide you can go back and get snippets from. I had to figure out how to make it so that new people can learn and people can just look at it for code snippets.</p>

<p>I had to figure out how I am going to style the content. Also had to figure out what every post will have.</p>

<p>For the nav I had to figure out what looked nice. I was thinking about either not having a hamburger menu on responsive and just have them be there or having a hamburger menu. I decided it looked better with the hamburger because I had more than 3 links.</p>
