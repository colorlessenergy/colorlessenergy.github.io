<h2 id="what-this-is">what this is</h2>
<!-- this is a site to showcase a product. This site was made to understand how
to animate with CSS. -->

<p>I made this site to understand how to to animate properly in CSS. I chose to not use any libraries or frameworks with the animations to understand what really is going on under the roof. I used owl carousel to make it easier to make a carousel so I can focus on animation which was the goal for building this site.</p>

<p>The first problem I faced was understanding how to animate HTML with CSS. I had to figure what I wanted to do first then went on google and looked up everything I needed help with.</p>

<p>The second problem I faced was having to understand the how to use owl carousel. The docs were good enough to be able to find what I needed. I had to experiment a lot to get what I wanted.</p>
